## GOALS
* Work on the iPhone and OS X.  On the iPhone we can replace NSXML* with DDXML* from
  KissXML (http://code.google.com/p/kissxml/) which aims to be a direct replacement for 
  NSXML on the iPhone.  

## TODO
* Type checking and conversion
* NSDictionary to XML
* Check out how to compile using KissXML or NSXML depending if KissXML is available.
* Allow the benchmark app to specify how many rounds we want.

## Running the benchmark
WARNING: committees.xml is 257kb and is parsed over 2500 times so it will take a 
while.
Simply build the foundation tool (command+B) and run:
    ./benchmark -f FILE_TO_PARSE -p yes
    // -f (REQUIRED) - File to parse
    // -p (OPTIONAL) - Print output

## Running Unit Tests
1. Build unittests bundle (command+b)
2. Set otest as active executable
3. command+alt+y (Run->Debug)
